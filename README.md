AIM:
To design and implement a 4x4 Vedic multiplier and a 4x4 Wallace multiplier.

4x4 VEDIC MULTIPLIER:
Vedic mathematics is the name given to the ancient Indian system of mathematics that was rediscovered
in the early twentieth century from ancient Indian sculptures (Vedas). It has a unique technique of 
calculations based on 16 Sutras.

A simple digital multiplier architecture based on the Urdhva Triyakbhyam (Vertically and Cross wise) Sutra
is being dealt with it in our problem statement. Further, the Verilog HDL coding (Mixed level modelling)
of the mentioned Sutra for 4x4 bits multiplication and their FPGA implementation by Xilinx Synthesis Tool 
on Spartan kit has been done and output has been displayed on LEDâ€™s of Spartan kit.

4x4 BINARY MULTIPLIER:
A basic multiplier consists of three parts: partial product generation, partial product addition and final addition.
A multiplier essentially consists of two operands; a multiplicand and a multiplier. In the first stage, the multiplicand 
and the multiplier are multiplied bit by bit to generate the partial product terms. The second stage includes addition 
of these partial product terms to generate the product. The partial products are added serially, reducing the design 
complexity.
